Brainstorm
    Users
    Auth 
    Recipes: create, update, delete, public/private
    Sharing: share with other users
    Group to share: 
    Group_id
    (owner)user_id
    (shared)user_id
    Grocery list
    Need connection with recipe and grocery list (if its in the recipe, then put on list)
    Events
    Need connection with event and recipes (if event calls for recipe)


Table ideas
    User: will hold info about the user, each line/row will be an individual user.
    Auth: will hold credentials for logging-in, each line/row will be an individual credential.
    Recipes: will hold info about recipes, each line/row will be an individual recipe.
    Shared_recipe_group: will hold all the posts made in a group, each line/row will be an individual group post
    Grocery_list: will hold info about the grocery list, each line/row will be an individual recipes
    Occasion_list: will hold info about the occasions, each line/row will be an individual recipes

Relationships
    One to one
        Users and auth because each user can only have one auth and an auth can only be correlated to one user
       
    One to many
        Users and grocery_list each user has a grocery list of many ingredients but only one list per user
        User to recipes users can have many recipes but recipes can be pinned to one user
        ingredient to recipes many ingredients in recipe but recipe calls ingredient once
        ingredient to grocery_list because grocery_list can have many ingredients but grocery_list calls ingredient once
    Many to many
        Occasion_list to occasionRecipe to recipes because the occasion can have many recipes and a recipe can be in many occasions
        User to shared_recipe_group because theres many users in a group and users can be in many groups
